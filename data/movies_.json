Pavan aims to impress \"English rose\" Chloe by taking her to the most authentic Indian restaurant in the city and eventually winning her over with a confident \"heart on the sleeve, sleeve in her face\" approach to romance.\nBut then Chloe upend Pavan's expectations, ordering an \"authentic\" Indian dish off-menu, demonstrating a rapport with the restaurant staff by speaking Hindi and eventually revealing to Pavan her past romance with another Indian man, who she backpacked with through India.\nPavan -- who ordered the somewhat cliched dosas at the restaurant -- becomes insecure, questioning his own authenticity as an Indian when faced with Chloe's obvious fluency with his supposedly \"native\" culture. As the night's misadventures continue, Pavan realizes he must either accept himself as he is, or spend the evening trying to keep up in a race he may not win.",

Wedding rings are off, talk is strained, and they are both distant and awkward around one another.\nAs they re-climb Ben A'an, they set off to close the chapter of another milestone in their life, one that took its toll on Joel and Millie. But as they embark on their quest, they confront the distance that has grown between them and exactly what happened to cause it.",

Abel will also face life on the streets, where he will likely lean on crime to make a living and face everyday threats of violence and uncertainty.\nFeeling bitter and rebellious, Abel struggles with the reality of never having been adopted -- a fate that many Ethiopian orphans face, in a country where five percent of its total population are orphaned and official policies closed off international adoptions in 2018. He will also face discrimination because orphans are regarded with suspicion and shame.\nKiya is still hopeful that he will find a family, but Abel still tries to prepare his brother for a more realistic future. When a prospective adoptive couple threatens to break the brothers apart, their future as a family hangs in the balance.",

She's going abroad for her cancer treatment but discovers her health is too poor for her to travel.\nA pair of strangers drive past the rich woman. They are on the way into a house in the woods, where a poor man is dying. The younger man, who is perhaps a family member, asks for his boots for work since the poor man won't need them anymore. But the man exacts a promise from him to be buried in his backyard with a headstone. The next day, the poor man dies.\nThe rich woman eventually dies as well. Though surrounded by the comfort that her wealth can buy, her passing is painful and lonely, and she accuses her nurse of neglect and incompetence. Meanwhile, with the poor man buried as requested, the young man who inherited his boots is reminded of his promise. He goes out into the woods and chops down a tree to make a simple cross for a headstone. The tree dies peacefully in the forest, its wood used to mark the burial site of the poor man.",

On his 70th birthday, having done nothing memorable or in his life, Ernie decides to end it.\nHis suicide attempt is unsuccessful, however, and punctures a hole in his ceiling.

The machine also can stop aging, keeping the salesman alive well into the current age. As he outlives his family, he becomes increasingly isolated and sad, breaking the magic of the shooting star machine.\nIncreasingly embittered and disillusioned, he repairs the machine and ventures out into the city but finds it hard to make sales in a fast-paced, skeptical modern age. He finds his own belief in his machine and even the goodness of humanity flagging. But with the help of a curious 8-year-old tagalong, he restores his faith in his magic and himself.",

He's using material from Mexican sweet potatoes -- the medicinal plant barbasco, a wild yam indigenous to the region -- to generate the hormone. But the experiment keeps failing.\nBut Luis faces potential conflict and tension about his work. His best friend is an influential priest in a local church and is against the idea of birth control altogether. And his wife wants to have a large family, though Luis is apprehensive, due to unresolved grief over a miscarriage and the pressures of providing for such a large family. Due to his fears, he tells no one about his scientific quest. But when Luis's work finally pays off, these conflicts come out into the open, forcing Luis to either stand by his convictions or face significant personal loss.",

Nothing deters the pursuing car, who relentlessly chases them, no matter what the brothers do. They manage to elude their pursuer, but as they travel deeper into the countryside, they can't escape themselves -- or the strange situation they've gotten themselves into.",

She puts on a guarded, unruffled demeanor, though certain moments -- a snide remark from a guard, or the knowing glances of the other visitors -- throw her off at times.\nBut then she settles into her visit with her father, both talking into phone receivers as a pane of glass separates them. Lacey listens to her father as he chats about his new lawyer, his hopes of a reduced sentencing, and his entreaties for Lacey to rustle up the entire family to visit for Easter. As Lacey loses patience with her father's delusions, she demands the truth from him. And what she discovers alters her relationship with him forever.",

Though they've tried to escape the hectic routines of their lives in the city, they can't quite escape their annoyance with one another.\nBut then everything goes awry, thanks to the accidental shooting of a gamekeeper accompanying them. As they try to grapple with the situation and what they've just done, their differences widen and test the fraying bonds of friendship and fraternity, even as they have to work together to get themselves out of their mess.\nThe set-up of THE LOST SCOT sounds almost like the beginning of a joke: What happens when a cynic, an alcoholic and an accountant get a hold of a gun? But filmmaker Julian Cornwall's comedic short takes that premise and runs with it in an energetic, fresh direction, with terrific writing and flawless creative execution.",

He's also a busy single parent who can't seem to get a break from his rambunctious kids, an angel and devil who are always fighting and baby Jesus screaming in the background.\nOne particular day when the kids are acting up and melting down, he's too busy to pay attention to his computer, and the cosmos goes slightly awry -- leading to a creation of a very different world as we know it.\nThis fun, rollicking animated short -- made by the team at acclaimed Danish animation house Tumblehead -- is a unique \"alternate world\" take on the story of creation, imagining the \"great creator\" in a new way that's likely highly relatable in the age of pandemic parenting, though the was made before the global onset of Covid-19. With great wit and an almost acrobatic sense of invention, it hops, skips and wiggles around the cosmos, imagining the comedic mayhem that results when the loose ends of creation are left dangling.\nPortrayed in a mix of 2D and 3D animation, the scale of the storytelling is vast, as the distracted half-made adjustments by God play out throughout the universe. Dinosaurs, people and other creatures evolve in unexpected ways, which play out over a wide-ranging tapestry of time and space. Adam -- the original man -- in particular has an eventful, consequential run-in with an alien, with amusing consequences.\nLike many animated shorts, it takes advantage of the imaginative possibilities of the medium to cram the 7-minute runtime with gags, jokes and flourishes of whimsy, starting with the creation of a universe by a computer program called Multiverse, which vaguely resembles an old program of Windows. It's funny to imagine that the whole of the cosmos can be compressed into one app, but with the vagaries of technology, it also means that mistakes can propagate much faster and much more widely.",

The moments of conflict expose the fault lines in the family, whether it's between traditionalists who hold onto their culture with an iron grip or the younger generations that are struggling to stay in touch with the old traditions.\nBut her defiance also makes way for a small moment of grace, giving her comfort and acceptance during her near unbearable loss.",

Looking for help, she becomes part of the quiet haven, and Marcus has always nursed a crush on her. But her presence draws in Darren, which threatens not just his private world, but his own safety.",

They're a happily married couple and treat one another as equals, with love, respect and affection, and their life together is prosperous and happy. But as a woman, Mina finds going outside her home to be hard, as she must follow many customs designed to protect her from the lecherous gazes of men. She wants to move abroad so she can live with more freedom, even though Tehran is their home.\nTo stay in their beloved city, Saeed invents the \"manchador,\" which covers up men's eyes so that they can't look upon women. Despite the skepticism, the manchador transforms Saeed's life, and he institutes the manchador at his company and lets the women be more comfortable without their scarves, which makes them more productive. The manchador even goes viral, transforming the very fabric of society itself. But soon the manchador draws the attention of the authorities, who shut Saeed down, forcing things back to the status quo but leaving Saeed with new questions to confront.",

With his family's blessing, he left behind four brothers, four sisters and his parents. Ultimately, he immigrated to the U.S. in 1979 for \"a better life and religious freedom.\"",

Their questions about the boy's fundamental innocence aren't just rhetorical: they hold the life and fate of the boy -- and maybe even the war itself -- in the balance.",

When Steve enters, it's clear he's an in-the-know man of the city, as well as a cool and handsome actor, and Natalie quite can't believe her luck.\nBut Steve has brought to this first date a strange neurosis that seems at first silly and eccentric -- a literal script of how he thinks the date should go. At first Natalie tries to humor Steve, but his insistence on them following the script derails the date, exposing Steve as a bit of a lunatic and leaving Natalie in a bind as she tries to extract herself from the situation.",

Despite the choreographer's exhortations to surrender to the primal violence of the dance, Simi just can't do it, held back by his own timidity as well as his unconfessed feelings for his fellow dancer Alanna.\nBut as Simi slow becomes jealous of the other men surrounding Alanna -- and his own life offers very few avenues of understanding, connection and acceptance -- he finds himself dealing with the growing intensity of his emotions for Alanna. But right before he goes onstage, he realizes just where he stands with his dance partner, leading to a dangerous, devastating pas de deux.",

Trent also struggles with a stutter, which sometimes makes running his business difficult.\nOn his way to a delivery at a wedding, his car has a spot of trouble. Calling customer service is difficult for someone who deals with a stutter, so he lugs his flowers to the nearest car rental place for a new state-of-the-art vehicle. But the car relies on voice-recognition tech to work, and Trent finds himself battling with the car -- and finding his voice in the process.",

As lead actor Juanma Chacon bobs and weaves through the interplay of dark and light, cheered on by the crowds, we see how boxing -- and  a growing sense of power -- becomes almost like a narcotic to the boxer.",

He meets with two young, ambitious Roman publishers, Julius and Atilus, in an attempt to sell it and put his work into the world. To Phineas, this latest work is his masterpiece, a story of personal sacrifice and an exploration of the human condition told from the perspective of humans, not gods.\nBut unfortunately for Phineas, the Roman publishers aren't as enthusiastic about his story. The Romans gradually add their own more \"market-friendly\" ideas, and Phineas resists, fighting for his artistic vision as he tries to prevent the dilution of his ideas. But eventually, what emerges from this ad-hoc \"collaboration\" changes the world forever.",

But when it comes time to test the vaccine by injecting smallpox into him, James resists, putting a strain between his father and Jenner that may challenge their struggling family even further.",

But then the little girl finds some money on the ground, which gives her an idea -- she can buy the ball all by herself.\nUndeterred, the little girl comes home and counts the money in her piggy bank. Coming up short, she decides to go through the process of earning money for it, whether it's washing the car, doing chores or selling lemonade. She also learns the value of saving her own money, and slowly but surely builds up her stash of savings. When she finally raises enough funds, she comes across one more obstacle before her heart's deepest wish can come true.",

The two friends are opposites: Gabby is rational, responsible and in a stable relationship with her fianc\u00e9 Tom, while Alexis is wild, reckless and free-spirited, exuberantly embracing her bipolar disorder. They are close, but as they share the same bed after their wild night, they venture beyond the confines of friendship into something more.\nBut in the cold light of the next morning, their fundamental differences reassert themselves. And both women are faced with a turning point in a complex, loving and sometimes difficult relationship.",

He concocts a scheme to help his father, buying cigarettes for a local teen, in exchange for a seat at a local poker game. But he soon finds himself in a world where he may be in over his head.\nWarm, witty and consistently compelling throughout, this coming-of-age dramedy captures a time and place through the eyes of a young boy growing up during a tumultuous time in culture. Frank treads the line between innocence and experience, but as he takes on situations that are far more mature than he can handle, he finds his relationships with his family shifting as well.",

        "synopsis": "Eli has recently experienced a devastating event: he's lost his young son. At odds with himself and lost in grief, he rattles around the house, paralyzed and unable to deal with the fallout.\nBut in the midst of his breakdown, he receives some inspiration and begins to make an unusual, whimsical ode to his departed son. But as it comes to its fullest fruition, it bears an unexpected consequence.\nFilmmaking duo Rebecca Kahn and Abhishek Prasad, this horror short is a dark, unexpected examination of grief, sadness and isolation, tinged with black humor and whimsy. Patiently and meticulously constructed from a stripped-down and disciplined script, it takes dark psychological themes, wraps them within an unexpected visual treatment and then upends the expectations it painstakingly builds up with a genuinely shocking ending.\nIt is a profoundly quiet film in many ways, starting with the studied, distant visual style. The visual language captures a sense of alienation, beginning with its reliance on mostly wide, almost abstract shorts, keeping viewers at arms' length at first as the camera observes Eli in his grief.\nThe images and pacing, as well as the relative lack of dialogue, is almost chilly at first, but captures something essential about how we experience tragedy as outsiders -- fascinated, but at a distance. The tone, too, captures the way grief can make us feel removed from the world -- and it's certainly how Eli feels, as he deals with his unimaginable loss.\nYet when he seems to receive a sign, he begins to conceive of an ode or memorial to his son. It's seemingly a colorful and charming one, which introduces a visual lightness and whimsy to the short. As the audience observes Eli at work, the images are so powerful that we feel aloft with hope and optimism. But Eli's ode to his son is deceptively joyful in its evocation of innocence, lightness and happiness.",

Ida is isolated, speaking only French in a region of Canada that speaks primarily English, and her cousin is her primary intermediary between her and the world.\nBut her cousin's attention and affection are soon consumed by his girlfriend Jane who has a clear dislike and annoyance with the little girl. As she cordons off Ben from his sister, Ida flees into the surrounding cornfields, where she makes a connection with a supernatural entity... one that may not be as benign as Ida thinks.",

He is the most popular stripper at the club and clearly knows his way around.\nBut there's more to Angel than his good looks and smooth moves. When his clients get a private show in the VIP room, they don't get a dance but something else: Angel's ability to really listen and empathize, helping confront the troubles in their own lives.\nOne night, his VIP of the evening, Michelle, has a hard time loosening up, since it's her first time at a place like Anywhere. Stuck in a marriage that feels inauthentic and insecure because she has to pretend to be someone else all the time, she finds herself opening up to Angel -- and being herself for the first time in years.\nAnother time, Angel goes into the back with Brian, who seems confident and boisterous. His facade begins to crack under Angel's open-mindedness and compassion, and he confesses the truth of his insecurity, lack of identity and the emptiness of his life. Once again, Angel gently points a client to a more whole, authentic way of being. But Angel himself will have a startling encounter, which may push him to evolve his mission.",

But they're similar in feeling the pain and suffering from disappointing interpersonal relationships. And with one another, they both find a way out of their heartache to move forward.",

As he begins to record jokes, requests and quips, a portrait emerges of a life lived fully and beautifully, even as it faces its final curve down the road. Finally, he embraces the opportunity to record his thoughts for posterity, and talks from the heart about his profound gratitude for Ben and their time together.",

He rescues the dog and takes it home, but when his landlord comes by demanding money, James is told the dog has to go. There's only one way to keep a pet at the complex: it has to be a service animal.

But she's coming of age -- and experiencing strange, surreal visions and premonitions -- just as a mysterious pandemic sweeps the world.\nAs the world devolves into panic and chaos, Maria starts to develop powers -- ones that unsettle her family. Maria must navigate increasingly dangerous circumstances in the world, just as the threat at home is beginning to creep into her life.\nStately in style, with stunning cinematography and beautifully composed images and camerawork, this dramatic fantasy-horror short from Ireland maximizes the power of cinematic art to create a haunting, captivating atmosphere, perfect for a metaphorical tale about an avenging goddess coming down to earth to wreak havoc.\nIts story unfurls with the logic and flow of a dream, with almost free-associative editing and a haunted, drifting sense of pacing, which reflect the inner life of its central character. Yet it also excels in portraying the larger canvas of a world falling apart at the seams, through well-calibrated hints in the storytelling and effectively deployed images of dystopia.\nMaria, like the viewer, is haunted by totem-like symbols and visions. In their strange and terrible beauty and savagery, they also reflect the encroachment of her autonomy and sovereignty, and her own fears and anxieties. The images themselves are often stunning in their depth of imagination and evocation of terror, and are rendered with an almost painterly sense of light and line that is both beautiful and eerie.\nActor Rayleen Kenny plays Maria with admirable restraint, navigating the line of a growing inner unease with the need to hide her experience, lest it draws even more trouble upon her. Yet her growing powers cannot be suppressed -- nor her anger and resentment -- and when she suffers a devastating betrayal, her powers are unleashed, enacting terrible revenge in the process.",
