He's using material from Mexican sweet potatoes -- the medicinal plant barbasco, a wild yam indigenous to the region -- to generate the hormone. But the experiment keeps failing.\nBut Luis faces potential conflict and tension about his work. His best friend is an influential priest in a local church and is against the idea of birth control altogether. And his wife wants to have a large family, though Luis is apprehensive, due to unresolved grief over a miscarriage and the pressures of providing for such a large family. Due to his fears, he tells no one about his scientific quest. But when Luis's work finally pays off, these conflicts come out into the open, forcing Luis to either stand by his convictions or face significant personal loss.",

One of her co-workers is skeptical of Maggie's efforts for a man who opened fire in a schoolyard and killed many young children, but the cook justifies it as an act of comfort for a man about to leave the land of the leaving and takes pride in her skill and work ethic.\nBut when her kindness doesn't land as intended, the cook reveals perhaps that there's more at work underneath her dignity and generosity than it seems.",

But Pia insists it was 7,000, which Graciela reluctantly complies with, trying to appease her boss.

Though they've tried to escape the hectic routines of their lives in the city, they can't quite escape their annoyance with one another.\nBut then everything goes awry, thanks to the accidental shooting of a gamekeeper accompanying them. As they try to grapple with the situation and what they've just done, their differences widen and test the fraying bonds of friendship and fraternity, even as they have to work together to get themselves out of their mess.\nThe set-up of THE LOST SCOT sounds almost like the beginning of a joke: What happens when a cynic, an alcoholic and an accountant get a hold of a gun? But filmmaker Julian Cornwall's comedic short takes that premise and runs with it in an energetic, fresh direction, with terrific writing and flawless creative execution.",

        "synopsis": "Up in the heavens, God is a stressed-out software developer, making adjustments to the cosmos on his computer as he tests out a new program called Multiverse. He's also a busy single parent who can't seem to get a break from his rambunctious kids, an angel and devil who are always fighting and baby Jesus screaming in the background.\nOne particular day when the kids are acting up and melting down, he's too busy to pay attention to his computer, and the cosmos goes slightly awry -- leading to a creation of a very different world as we know it.\nThis fun, rollicking animated short -- made by the team at acclaimed Danish animation house Tumblehead -- is a unique \"alternate world\" take on the story of creation, imagining the \"great creator\" in a new way that's likely highly relatable in the age of pandemic parenting, though the was made before the global onset of Covid-19. With great wit and an almost acrobatic sense of invention, it hops, skips and wiggles around the cosmos, imagining the comedic mayhem that results when the loose ends of creation are left dangling.\nPortrayed in a mix of 2D and 3D animation, the scale of the storytelling is vast, as the distracted half-made adjustments by God play out throughout the universe. Dinosaurs, people and other creatures evolve in unexpected ways, which play out over a wide-ranging tapestry of time and space. Adam -- the original man -- in particular has an eventful, consequential run-in with an alien, with amusing consequences.\nLike many animated shorts, it takes advantage of the imaginative possibilities of the medium to cram the 7-minute runtime with gags, jokes and flourishes of whimsy, starting with the creation of a universe by a computer program called Multiverse, which vaguely resembles an old program of Windows. It's funny to imagine that the whole of the cosmos can be compressed into one app, but with the vagaries of technology, it also means that mistakes can propagate much faster and much more widely.",

At odds with himself and lost in grief, he rattles around the house, paralyzed and unable to deal with the fallout.\nBut in the midst of his breakdown, he receives some inspiration and begins to make an unusual, whimsical ode to his departed son. But as it comes to its fullest fruition, it bears an unexpected consequence.\nFilmmaking duo Rebecca Kahn and Abhishek Prasad, this horror short is a dark, unexpected examination of grief, sadness and isolation, tinged with black humor and whimsy. Patiently and meticulously constructed from a stripped-down and disciplined script, it takes dark psychological themes, wraps them within an unexpected visual treatment and then upends the expectations it painstakingly builds up with a genuinely shocking ending.\nIt is a profoundly quiet film in many ways, starting with the studied, distant visual style. The visual language captures a sense of alienation, beginning with its reliance on mostly wide, almost abstract shorts, keeping viewers at arms' length at first as the camera observes Eli in his grief.\nThe images and pacing, as well as the relative lack of dialogue, is almost chilly at first, but captures something essential about how we experience tragedy as outsiders -- fascinated, but at a distance. The tone, too, captures the way grief can make us feel removed from the world -- and it's certainly how Eli feels, as he deals with his unimaginable loss.\nYet when he seems to receive a sign, he begins to conceive of an ode or memorial to his son. It's seemingly a colorful and charming one, which introduces a visual lightness and whimsy to the short. As the audience observes Eli at work, the images are so powerful that we feel aloft with hope and optimism. But Eli's ode to his son is deceptively joyful in its evocation of innocence, lightness and happiness.",

Though she knows wanting to kill someone is wrong, the ferocity of her feelings pushes her over the edge.\nSeeking help, she tries to find solace and guidance from a local vicar, Father Hill. The vicar himself is a man who faces racial abuse, and he also struggles with feelings of anger, revenge and retribution. Despite his prayers for her and the counsel he tries to give her, Laura begins going down a dark path, stalking the drunk driver, who is still a heavy drinker. Her conscience tortures her for her choices -- and begins to pull in the vicar -- until the war between her morality and her thirst for revenge pushes her to the brink.",

But as the occasion of the funeral nears and the realization that it's for someone they know begins to sink in, their thoughts turn to death, mortality and what it means to live.",

He is the most popular stripper at the club and clearly knows his way around.\nBut there's more to Angel than his good looks and smooth moves. When his clients get a private show in the VIP room, they don't get a dance but something else: Angel's ability to really listen and empathize, helping confront the troubles in their own lives.\nOne night, his VIP of the evening, Michelle, has a hard time loosening up, since it's her first time at a place like Anywhere. Stuck in a marriage that feels inauthentic and insecure because she has to pretend to be someone else all the time, she finds herself opening up to Angel -- and being herself for the first time in years.\nAnother time, Angel goes into the back with Brian, who seems confident and boisterous. His facade begins to crack under Angel's open-mindedness and compassion, and he confesses the truth of his insecurity, lack of identity and the emptiness of his life. Once again, Angel gently points a client to a more whole, authentic way of being. But Angel himself will have a startling encounter, which may push him to evolve his mission.",

It's not just an attempt to capture a moment for the pair, but a task they need to complete for their immigration application. Mina is preoccupied with making sure the photo is perfect, and she worries that Feras isn't taking it seriously, especially with Mina pregnant with their child.\nAs they try to get the picture right, their playful banter turns into bickering, and then a full-blown argument, which reveals the tension they face separately as non-white Londoners and the obstacles they face as a mixed-race couple. But it also reveals their loyalty, devotion and love for one another, and their promise as a couple and a family.",

But before the boy can wonder who the stranger is, he's told to do his chores by his father, Mr. Jones, a stern and harsh man. This is the same man who will murder his wife and mother at the breakfast table, right in front of the boy and his sister Lucy.\nThe two terrified children remain on the isolated farm with their father, who slowly twists the children's questions around to sculpt a new memory of what happened in the children's mind.\nHe also begins to be a little kinder to Freddy and Lucy, though a tinge of threat rears its head when Freddy especially questions the details that the father begins to plant in his children's minds, especially that of a stranger with red hair, big white teeth and white hands who came into the home and hit their mother in the head.\nBut despite everything, justice catches up to the father -- though not without having an indelible, chilling effect on the minds of his two young children.",

But she's coming of age -- and experiencing strange, surreal visions and premonitions -- just as a mysterious pandemic sweeps the world.\nAs the world devolves into panic and chaos, Maria starts to develop powers -- ones that unsettle her family. Maria must navigate increasingly dangerous circumstances in the world, just as the threat at home is beginning to creep into her life.\nStately in style, with stunning cinematography and beautifully composed images and camerawork, this dramatic fantasy-horror short from Ireland maximizes the power of cinematic art to create a haunting, captivating atmosphere, perfect for a metaphorical tale about an avenging goddess coming down to earth to wreak havoc.\nIts story unfurls with the logic and flow of a dream, with almost free-associative editing and a haunted, drifting sense of pacing, which reflect the inner life of its central character. Yet it also excels in portraying the larger canvas of a world falling apart at the seams, through well-calibrated hints in the storytelling and effectively deployed images of dystopia.\nMaria, like the viewer, is haunted by totem-like symbols and visions. In their strange and terrible beauty and savagery, they also reflect the encroachment of her autonomy and sovereignty, and her own fears and anxieties. The images themselves are often stunning in their depth of imagination and evocation of terror, and are rendered with an almost painterly sense of light and line that is both beautiful and eerie.\nActor Rayleen Kenny plays Maria with admirable restraint, navigating the line of a growing inner unease with the need to hide her experience, lest it draws even more trouble upon her. Yet her growing powers cannot be suppressed -- nor her anger and resentment -- and when she suffers a devastating betrayal, her powers are unleashed, enacting terrible revenge in the process.",

When he returned, he collaborated with his brother and filmmaker partner Myles on a uniquely hypnotic and visually arresting animated travelogue, full of small vivid moments, stories that capture the sense of an eternal Americana and characters that seem to exist in their own netherworld.",
