CmQneYZvTlM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmQneYZvTlM,TALES FROM THE MULTIVERSE,God tries to create 'Earth'. But he can't get a break from the kids.,"Up in the heavens, God is a stressed-out software developer, making adjustments to the cosmos on his computer as he tests out a new program called Multiverse. He's also a busy single parent who can't seem to get a break from his rambunctious kids, an angel and devil who are always fighting and baby Jesus screaming in the background.
One particular day when the kids are acting up and melting down, he's too busy to pay attention to his computer, and the cosmos goes slightly awry -- leading to a creation of a very different world as we know it.
This fun, rollicking animated short -- made by the team at acclaimed Danish animation house Tumblehead -- is a unique ""alternate world"" take on the story of creation, imagining the ""great creator"" in a new way that's likely highly relatable in the age of pandemic parenting, though the was made before the global onset of Covid-19. With great wit and an almost acrobatic sense of invention, it hops, skips and wiggles around the cosmos, imagining the comedic mayhem that results when the loose ends of creation are left dangling.
Portrayed in a mix of 2D and 3D animation, the scale of the storytelling is vast, as the distracted half-made adjustments by God play out throughout the universe. Dinosaurs, people and other creatures evolve in unexpected ways, which play out over a wide-ranging tapestry of time and space. Adam -- the original man -- in particular has an eventful, consequential run-in with an alien, with amusing consequences.
Like many animated shorts, it takes advantage of the imaginative possibilities of the medium to cram the 7-minute runtime with gags, jokes and flourishes of whimsy, starting with the creation of a universe by a computer program called Multiverse, which vaguely resembles an old program of Windows. It's funny to imagine that the whole of the cosmos can be compressed into one app, but with the vagaries of technology, it also means that mistakes can propagate much faster and much more widely.",2021-01-31,423.0,English,USA,assets/thumbnails/CmQneYZvTlM.webp

bkXL_eDKJa4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkXL_eDKJa4,UPLIFT,A grieving father buys balloons for an ode to his departed son.,"Eli has recently experienced a devastating event: he's lost his young son. At odds with himself and lost in grief, he rattles around the house, paralyzed and unable to deal with the fallout.
But in the midst of his breakdown, he receives some inspiration and begins to make an unusual, whimsical ode to his departed son. But as it comes to its fullest fruition, it bears an unexpected consequence.
Filmmaking duo Rebecca Kahn and Abhishek Prasad, this horror short is a dark, unexpected examination of grief, sadness and isolation, tinged with black humor and whimsy. Patiently and meticulously constructed from a stripped-down and disciplined script, it takes dark psychological themes, wraps them within an unexpected visual treatment and then upends the expectations it painstakingly builds up with a genuinely shocking ending.
It is a profoundly quiet film in many ways, starting with the studied, distant visual style. The visual language captures a sense of alienation, beginning with its reliance on mostly wide, almost abstract shorts, keeping viewers at arms' length at first as the camera observes Eli in his grief.
The images and pacing, as well as the relative lack of dialogue, is almost chilly at first, but captures something essential about how we experience tragedy as outsiders -- fascinated, but at a distance. The tone, too, captures the way grief can make us feel removed from the world -- and it's certainly how Eli feels, as he deals with his unimaginable loss.
Yet when he seems to receive a sign, he begins to conceive of an ode or memorial to his son. It's seemingly a colorful and charming one, which introduces a visual lightness and whimsy to the short. As the audience observes Eli at work, the images are so powerful that we feel aloft with hope and optimism. But Eli's ode to his son is deceptively joyful in its evocation of innocence, lightness and happiness.",2020-08-21,675.0,English,USA,assets/thumbnails/bkXL_eDKJa4.webp

xDW0EaSnznY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDW0EaSnznY,WRATH,A young woman has an ominous dream as a mysterious pandemic sweeps over the world.,"Maria is a young girl on the brink of adulthood. But she's coming of age -- and experiencing strange, surreal visions and premonitions -- just as a mysterious pandemic sweeps the world.
As the world devolves into panic and chaos, Maria starts to develop powers -- ones that unsettle her family. Maria must navigate increasingly dangerous circumstances in the world, just as the threat at home is beginning to creep into her life.
Stately in style, with stunning cinematography and beautifully composed images and camerawork, this dramatic fantasy-horror short from Ireland maximizes the power of cinematic art to create a haunting, captivating atmosphere, perfect for a metaphorical tale about an avenging goddess coming down to earth to wreak havoc.
Its story unfurls with the logic and flow of a dream, with almost free-associative editing and a haunted, drifting sense of pacing, which reflect the inner life of its central character. Yet it also excels in portraying the larger canvas of a world falling apart at the seams, through well-calibrated hints in the storytelling and effectively deployed images of dystopia.
Maria, like the viewer, is haunted by totem-like symbols and visions. In their strange and terrible beauty and savagery, they also reflect the encroachment of her autonomy and sovereignty, and her own fears and anxieties. The images themselves are often stunning in their depth of imagination and evocation of terror, and are rendered with an almost painterly sense of light and line that is both beautiful and eerie.
Actor Rayleen Kenny plays Maria with admirable restraint, navigating the line of a growing inner unease with the need to hide her experience, lest it draws even more trouble upon her. Yet her growing powers cannot be suppressed -- nor her anger and resentment -- and when she suffers a devastating betrayal, her powers are unleashed, enacting terrible revenge in the process.",2021-03-25,547.0,English,USA,assets/thumbnails/xDW0EaSnznY.webp
